      <p>
        When user click get now button on home page they will redirect to
        courses page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way is that user can directly click on the courses element on
        navbar and simply redirect to courses page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here user get an interphase which contain all the logo of courses with
        great hover effect and title effect as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the above picture shows when user hover over course they will get a
        nice effect and when user click on the course logo, they will simply
        return on the courses section where the particular section has been
        mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>For more info see the picture below:</p>
